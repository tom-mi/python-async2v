    marked for execution. Its `process` method will be invoked when the component runner is given control by the asyncio
    scheduler. That does not happen immediately - further events (also on different fields) can arrive between the
    trigger and the actual invocation of the `process` method. Those events don't lead to additional invocations.

    The guarantees by the framework are:

    * if this method has been called, at least one event has arrived on any of the trigger fields
    * if any of the trigger fields receives an event, a method invocation is scheduled and performed as soon as
      possible (if not already scheduled)
