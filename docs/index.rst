async2v
=======

Framework for building computer-vision prototypes.

It is based on `asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_.
To get the most out of it, `pygame <https://www.pygame.org/>`_ and `OpenCV <https://opencv.org/>`_ are required.

**Write less boilerplate, instead focus on the interesting things.**
