# python-async2v

Framework for building computer-vision prototypes.

It is based on [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).
To get the most out of it, [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) are required.

**Write less boilerplate, instead focus on the interesting things.**
