# python-async2v

Framework for rapid prototyping of computer-vision software.

It is based on [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).
To get the most out of it, [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) are required.

*Write less boilerplate, instead focus on the interesting things.*
